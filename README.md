# Coeditor

Yet Another Pair Programming Package for Atom.

![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)

## Features
+ Non-conflict collaborative text editing
+ Text highlight synchronization
+ Collaborative awareness
+ Project sync
+ File grammar sync
+ Active tab sync
+ Project's files saving and closing sync

## Known issue
+ If clients use different types for line ending (i.e. CRLF or LF) with each other, this package will cause files end up with inconsistent content.
**MAKE SURE ALL CLIENTS USE THE SAME TYPE FOR LINE ENDING AND SET TYPE IN PACKAGE'S SETTING VIEW! (EITHER CRLF OR LF WILL DO)** 

## TODO
+ ~~Customized configuration (Server address, random session id or given by user)~~ DONE
+ ~~Broadcast disconnections to other living Atom clients~~ DONE
+ ~~Check socket status before using~~ DONE
+ ~~Broadcast server close to each Atom clients, and disconnect all clients~~ DONE
+ ~~Text selection background and cursor colors for different Atom clients ?~~ DONE  
+ Suggestions Synchronization NO API
+ ~~Settings view~~ DONE
+ ~~Working folder files synchronization~~ DONE
+ ~~File operations synchronization~~ DONE
  - ~~save -- DONE, but limited, don't work for new file which does not have path~~
  - ~~close~~
+ ~~Tab sync~~
+ Heartbeat between client and server
+ Build cloud server
+ Write spec

## Tentative
+ ~~Working folder files synchronization~~ MOVED TO TODO list
+ Server uses in-memory storage when running, so no file content will be stored in server when it is shutdown, might change to MongoDB
